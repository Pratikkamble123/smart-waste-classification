# Smart Waste Classification System using Computer Vision

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Waste Classification System** leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically classify waste into categories such as **biodegradable**, **non-biodegradable**, and **recyclable**. This project aims to assist in efficient waste segregation, reduce manual labor, and promote sustainable environmental practices.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time waste classification using image input
- Pre-trained machine learning model for accurate predictions
- Categorization into major waste types: biodegradable, non-biodegradable, recyclable
- Simple and intuitive user interface (CLI or GUI)
- Scalable system for integration with smart bins or waste management systems

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Flask (for deployment, optional)**

## 🧠 Model Training

1. Image dataset of various waste categories collected from public sources or Kaggle.
2. Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. CNN-based architecture trained on labeled images.
4. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.



## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-waste-classifier.git
   cd smart-waste-classifier
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run prediction script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
   ```

4. (Optional) Run web app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 📊 Future Scope

* Expand dataset with more categories (e-waste, hazardous waste)
* Deploy on edge devices (like Raspberry Pi)
* Integrate with IoT-based smart bins
* Real-time video classification from CCTV
