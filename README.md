# ♻️ Smart Waste Classification System using Computer Vision

A computer vision-powered system to automatically classify waste into **biodegradable**, **non-biodegradable**, and **recyclable** categories, helping automate waste segregation and promote eco-friendly waste management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Waste Classification System** uses image recognition and a trained deep learning model to classify waste items. It can be integrated into smart bins or deployed as a desktop or web app, aiming to reduce human error and optimize waste handling operations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Real-time waste detection and classification
- 🔍 Accurate predictions using a trained CNN model
- ♻️ Categorization into:
  - Biodegradable
  - Non-Biodegradable
  - Recyclable
- 💻 Command-line and optional web-based interface
- 🧩 Scalable design for smart city or IoT integration
